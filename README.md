# icp-to-opbnb-test

Welcome to icp-to-opbnb-test, a repository dedicated to testing the integration between the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) canisters and the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), specifically focusing on the OPBNB chain. This project showcases how to request rewards from an ICP canister and verify the reception of these rewards at a specific address on the OPBNB chain.

## Overview
This repository contains all the necessary code and documentation for initiating a reward request from an ICP canister to a smart contract on the OPBNB chain. It demonstrates the seamless integration between two of the most innovative blockchain technologies, facilitating a bridge for transactions and data sharing. The primary goal is to ensure developers can implement and test the transfer of rewards from ICP to OPBNB without hassle.

## Features
ICP Canister Example: An example canister, showcasing how to initiate a reward request.
opBNB Smart Contract: A sample smart contract on the opBNB chain that processes reward requests and distributes rewards to specified addresses.
